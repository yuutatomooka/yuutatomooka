# Hi, I'm Yuuta 👋  

Computer Science undergraduate at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://wisc.edu).  
I'm passionate about building AI systems that bridge technology and society — with a focus on misinformation detection, AI safety, and responsible implementation.

I’m particularly interested in how large language models can be made not only powerful, but reliable, transparent, and socially trustworthy.

## 🌏 Why I Care

AI is increasingly shaping public discourse, decision-making, and governance.  
I believe technical innovation must be paired with responsibility and real-world applicability.

My long-term goal is to contribute to trustworthy and human-centered AI implementation — helping connect global research with practical deployment, especially in Japan.
